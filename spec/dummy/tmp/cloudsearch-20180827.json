Who reads a book so controversial and confusing? And why?\n\nlist\n  lis\n  dfjaklsdfjklasd\n  dkfaj;sdlkfja\n  dfjsadfj’asd\nI’ve been both offended and disappointed in what the Bible has to say. I’ve been just as profoundly comforted and inspired. I’ve loved the words I found, and I’ve had long seasons of not picking it up at all. Whether you’re certain God doesn’t exist, unsure, don’t care, or read it all the time, we could all use a highlight reel.\n\nSo, while I sit with a glass of wine, here is my informal retelling of the entire Bible. You’re welcome.\n\nFirst, it’s all one story.\nFrom the beginning to right now, God designed us for freedom and relationship.\n\nPart One: The Beginning (Found in the Old Testament)\nBefore anything, there was the Father (God), the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit.\nThey experience perfect relationship.\nGod craved even more relationship and created a gorgeous world, full of life, beauty, and potential.\nFree from pain, fear, and sadness.\nThen He added some robots.\nJust kidding. No robots.\nHe created the opposite: humans in his image.\nThat’s important!\nFree beings who have the capacity for genuine love.\nThe type of love that wrecks and restores your entire soul.\nSounds obvious that you’d want that sort of being. But it required an incredibly massive risk.\nTo really love, you have to have a choice.\n\nSo He made man and woman.\n\nWe were made to depend on Him for everything.\n\nBut not in a controlling way.\n\nIn a “good Dad who perfectly provides” kind of way.\n\nSo we would never have to worry or be afraid.\n\nHe empowered us wildly. Giving us authority over all the earth and crazy freedom.\n\nOne of God’s angels was so jealous of this, he left God’s side and became the most cunning enemy ever.\n\nAnd we became the battlefield.\n\nThis enemy’s ways are so subtle and seductive though, half the time we welcome it.\n\nHe knew we were to grow into the fullness of God, so he lied that he had a shortcut.\n\n“This will give you what you want faster. You can be like God. Trust me. What could go wrong?”\n\nEverything.\n\nThe first time we had a choice: a faster way to get what we wanted and do it our way, we took it.\n\nInstead of depending on God and trusting him, we chose independence and separation.\n\nThe relationship was tainted. Doubt, shame, and pride started spreading like wildfire.\n\nGod’s heart broke for the destruction he knew was coming. But he didn’t regret his choice to give us freedom.\n\nHe still didn’t want mindless obedience or obligatory relationship.\n\nHe vowed to win us back.\n\nTo show us his goodness. To restore our relationship and freedom.\n\nThat’s the first book of the Bible, Genesis. I’m spending disproportionate time there because how the story starts is really, really important.\n\nThe rest of the first half goes like this: \nWe chose everything from selfishness to murder.\nBut God loved in a fiercer way than the enemy ever imagined. \nHe was prepared to conquer the divide we created. No matter the cost. \nHe had a plan and began preparing us to recognize it so we could choose another way.\nFirst, he found a guy named Abraham who was trustworthy. He blessed his family as a new start. \nA family who would represent God’s design for families who could expand and adopt all who wanted to belong. \nMeanwhile, we kept doing our own thing. \nNot taking His words seriously. Doing what felt right at the moment. Missing the bigger picture.\nWe landed ourselves in literal slavery. God would rescue us, and then we’d actually go back to slavery.\nSo He gave us “the Law” to show us how to re-engage relationship. To see how we needed him. \nRules that sound crazy now, but back then they protected us.\n(Like don’t eat some meat, because the FDA doesn’t exist yet. You’ll die.)\nHe sent prophets (people who hear him and tell others what they hear.) \nHe gave kings because we said we preferred a human to rule us.\nHe wrote poetry with messages like, Don’t lean on your own understanding. Trust me. I’m for you.\nHe accommodated us again and again. \nHe spent generations training us in traditions that would remind us who we are. That would help us find him. \nSome listened. Many missed it. For many, many years.\n\nPart Two (The New Testament)\nSo God initiated the rescue plan. The up-close, personal, perfect, only solution to the mess. \nJesus left the perfection of heaven to meet us personally. \nHe gave up all his comfort and entered all our pain. He lived a perfect life for 33 years.\nRight in the mess of it with us, He modeled another way. \nSpiritually, He was King, but he chose to live like a servant. \nOur history of bad choices was racking up a huge debt. \nWe were cashing cosmic checks that we could never repay. \nOffending a Creator & King in ways we could never reconcile on our own. \nWhile it seems complex, it’s really simple. \nChoosing God brings life. Believing the enemy leads to death.\nGod hates death. So to end it, Jesus offered himself. \nHe took death on, so there could be a bridge back to the original design. \nAnd (spoiler alert) Jesus literally beat the grave. \nHe came back to life, telling death, “Anyone with me does not have to be afraid of you. \nWith me, they can be free.”\nThen he left us the Spirit. Jesus said it was even better than having him. \nThe Spirit could unleash all His power, moving through his people on earth. \nIt would conquer oppression, pain, division, and evil. \nThe Spirit helps us live out the image of God that was imprinted on us from the beginning. \nFreedom and relationship could flow again.\n\nThe rest (starting in Acts) shows what happened after Jesus left all the way to what will happen in the end. \nThe people who choose to believe Jesus—like, really believe—become the Church. \nThis can be confusing, because a lot of people say they believe, but they don’t live differently. \nThey probably believe a little, but struggle to really receive grace and power.\nBut just because many miss it doesn’t mean it’s not true.\nThe Spirit came to live in us giving power as often as we choose to receive him.\nHe’s here to keep the relationship going: deeply, intimately, constantly a part of who we are. \nThose who noticed their need and cared to see got set free. \nLike really free: demons fled, sickness disappeared. Miracles everywhere. \nThe Church profoundly changed the world.\nThey grew into a new family overflowing with generosity, hospitality, justice, and love. \nThey multiplied into people of all colors, languages, and stories across the world. \nThey took care of the poor, made disciple-making disciples, and showed God’s relentless love.\nThey are meant to be representatives of Jesus until he comes back one last time. \nBut the enemy is still active. Still lying. Still separating us from God. So we often get stuck. \nWe fall back into the original mistake of believing the enemy and depending on ourselves. \nForgetting we’re not meant to strive for ourselves or have any fear. (We forget a lot.)\n\nMost of the rest is a series of letters from a leader named Paul. He kept messaging the spreading Church trying to help us remember:\n\nGuys, don’t forget—it’s about relationship and freedom. \nJust like the beginning, we’re meant to depend on Him and receive. More love, grace, and freedom. \nThen we can follow Jesus from that place—rooted in the new identity we get from him.\nIt’s not about what we do. It’s about who we are.\nNothing we’ve done is too bad. He beat death. \nWhen we let God make us who we are, we become someone pretty magnificent. \nSomeone loved who loves. Someone healed who heals. Someone free who sets others free. \nWe change the world first by choosing to be changed. \nIf we choose it, that is. (He won’t make us, because—freedom.)\n\nThe last book is called Revelation. It says:\nSomeday, Jesus will be back. \nWe’ll experience the original beauty and perfection of the world. \nAll our doubt, pain, shame, and fear will be gone. \nIt’ll be clear when it happens. No one will miss it. Everything will make sense.\n\nIt’s a beautiful story. \nHard to read, but worth the effort. \nWhenever we try, he promises to be found.\nYou should definitely check it out.\n\nStill too long?\n(Seriously? I just summarized like a million pages for you, but OK.)\nGod made us to be free because he wants relationship with us. \nWe struggle to trust and choose our own way instead.\nThat creates incredible pain, and God’s heart breaks to restore it. \nSo Jesus came to set things right.\nHe died for us so that we could be free.\nHe left his Spirit who has even more freedom. \nSo take it. Take the freedom. \nYou have to trade in your “wisdom” for faith instead. \nBut give it a try. Let God provide. Make Jesus King. \nThen don’t be a robot. Have a relationship.\nLet it free you. \nPass the freedom along.\n\nWant to read more? Search topics you’re curious about on BibleGateway.com, or try The Jesus StoryBook Bible.

I’m a normal kid, I think. I like to play catch like most kids my age. Is my arm too weak? Am I not dressed the right way? Are there too many people already playing?\n\nLittle did we know that interaction was fostering biases in both of us that would affect us for the rest of our lives. Well, at least mine.\n\nHi. My name is Malcolm Henderson, and I am a 26-year-old black man. Why did I call out my race? Keep reading.\n\nI wish I could say that baseball game was the last time my complexion caused an issue for me. I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, a pretty diverse city compared to most. My family was like the Huxtables, we were the one successful black family in the suburbs wherever we moved. Initially, living around people who didn’t look like me wasn’t a huge deal. We still went to an all-black Baptist church, so I had drops of diversity sprinkled throughout my life.\n\nIt wasn’t until high school that I realized that just by my physical appearance, I intimidated some people and gave them a reason to treat me differently. Like one beautiful summer day during my freshman year, when school was out and so was the sun. I decided to take a two-mile walk to Kroger. Why? Because I’m an only child and that’s what only children do. With all of the steep hills in my neighborhood, walking seemed better than biking at the time. Eventually, I made it to Kroger and walked in with my drawstring backpack. My mom had asked me to pick up a few toiletries—soap, lotion, Q-Tips, you get the idea. But being the forgetful kid I was, I picked up the bottle of lotion and quickly realized I had walked two miles without my wallet. Classic, right? I walked down a couple more aisles, placed the bottle of lotion down in a random spot, and headed for the door. I got about halfway out of the parking lot when two prevention loss employees approached me.\n\n“Thought you’d get away with that, huh?” One of them said.\n“What do you mean, sir?” (Growing up in a Christian, military household, manners were a must.)\n“Don’t play dumb. We saw you steal that bottle of lotion! You people are always stealing sh*t from this store.” \n“I promise, sir, I didn’t. I put it down in another aisle. I can show you where I placed it.”\n\nIn the longest three minutes of my life. I was “Malcolm in the Middle” between two white men who had their hands on both of my shoulders, gripping me tightly. Shaking, I walked through the store trying not to forget where I placed the lotion and praying that it was still there. I eventually got to the aisle and showed them where I put the bottle.\n\n“You’re lucky this time.”\n\nIt was the only thing they said to me, and then they walked away.\n\nI ran out of the store and literally cried the entire walk home.\n\nSo many emotions were going through my mind and body: anger, confusion, fear. Why were they so mean to me? Why did they assume I stole the lotion? I got home and asked my mom those exact same questions. She realized it was time to have the dreaded but very necessary “black talk.” She explained the difficult history of black and white people in America. How despite slavery being abolished and the progress our nation made through the Civil Rights era, racism, discrimination, prejudice, biases, and hate still exist on both sides. It was from that moment forward that I started to become very aware of how my race affected my daily life.\n\nI started to notice that depending on the time of day, where I was, what I was doing, and what I was wearing, people treated me differently. People followed me in stores while I was shopping, gripped their belongings if I was walking behind them, or gave me awkward stares when I walked into certain places. Could I have been over-analyzing these situations? Possibly. But I think it’s fair to say that being a six foot, 185-pound black man in a predominately affluent white area made some people a little uncomfortable.\n\nBut why? Thinking back to that playground moment, I have realized it is a part of how we have been conditioned as humans. It’s based on what we’re taught, perceptions and understanding of what we’ve seen, and what we’ve experienced. None of it is our fault, but we do have the opportunity and the responsibility to change it.\n\nFast-forward 12 years from that Kroger tragedy of 2006. The racial and political climate has changed dramatically. It seems that not only are we still conditioned to have those biases and hate, but we have also been given the permission and have the ‘right’ to act on them as well. Within the past two years, I have received even more awkward stares than normal. The difference in these scowls is that they now have a very obvious look of disgust, judgment, and hate. It may have something to do with the fact that I’m now married to a white woman, and we live in Northern Kentucky. Even though our parents are huge fans of our marriage, not everyone shares that sentiment.\n\nCould I be over-analyzing these situations again? Maybe. But getting the evil-eye is now accompanied with hateful comments (all said when I’m out with my wife, Erin):\n\n“You two are bold coming in here together.” \n“I wonder what her parents think about her being with a monkey.”\n“You’re ruining the pure and perfect race.”\n“All of these ni**ers keep taking our good women.”\n\nYes, people have actually said these directly to us, or loud enough for us to hear—and yes, these have all been in the 21st century. Shocking, I know. It seems that the same misunderstanding and fear that caused people to treat me differently over 10 years ago has shifted to hostility and aggression.\n\nI went from feeling like I was the cause of fear for some to now fearing for myself.\n\nI’m an American, and I don’t feel safe in my own country. Between the current racial climate I see in the media and my personal interactions with other people, some days I feel like I’m one interaction away from being the next hashtag.\n\nIt’s easy for me to think about these situations and quickly put all people in a certain category. I have also realized that is the same exact thing I wish people wouldn’t do to me. Instead of quickly going to anger, what I have found to be most effective is quite the opposite. I believe that because most of the hate I’ve experienced stems from the fear and misunderstanding I mentioned earlier, I have an awesome opportunity to change it.\n\nHow, Malcolm? You’re only one person. Great question. Instead of looking at those interactions as potential altercations and having my guard up, I try to see them as opportunities for me to change perceptions. If someone has been conditioned to dislike me based on the color of my skin, the only thing that will change that is something they experience that goes against their conditioning.\n\nCan I say that my heart still doesn’t beat fast every time I get pulled over? No, but despite my fear (irrational or not), I choose to show those officers a glimpse of Jesus during our interaction. That looks like believing the best about them instead of assuming the worst, treating them with the utmost respect, thanking them for their service, and trying to find common ground. I regularly have to ask myself, “Malcolm, do you want to be right or do you want to be better—?” I have to continually fight my human condition to want to be right (individually) and replace it with Jesus’ condition to want us to be better (collectively). It isn’t easy, but Jesus doesn’t call us only to do things that are.\n\nSo what can everyone do? We can all be intentional about surrounding ourselves and learning from people who don’t look like us.\n\nWhy would that help? Because when we do that, we have no choice but to gain empathy. We learn that people have different upbringings, face various obstacles, and have opposite points of view. The surprising but beautiful thing is that we also discover we have more in common than we realize.\n\nI challenge you to have a cup of coffee with someone who doesn’t look like you and bring up a hot topic like kneeling during the national anthem, law enforcement and black men, etc. Did those examples make you uncomfortable? I wouldn’t blame you if they did. But I have personally sought out these conversations, and on the other side of them is more growth and bonding than I ever thought possible.\n\nHeaven is going to be filled with tons of people who don’t look like me, and I can’t wait for that! I’m also going to do everything I can to reflect that here on Earth. Join me in the six steps  below this week.\n\nFind that person.\nSet up the coffee date.\nBring up the hot topic.\nListen to understand, not to respond.\nWatch Jesus show up.\nRepeat.\n\n","link":"https://mediaint.crossroads.net/articles/i-dont-feel-safe-in-my-own-country","type":"MediaResource"}},{"id":"CF_p9oq1ve41d7r_69gt1DIsnKQkGuEgG468EU","type":"add","fields":{"title":"Where was God on the worst night of my life?","content":"My wife and I had finally gotten our kids to bed, and the cool summer air was calling my name. Running is just as important to my mental health as my physical. So feeling the pull of the concrete, I found my shoes, put on my headphones, and was out the door.\n\nI’d already gone almost three miles, and was coming around a blind corner, back to our house. I’d been asking one question the entire time I ran. Not out loud, mind you. That’d be weird. But I kept bringing my prayer, my thoughts, back to the same thing. I wanted an answer. And, to be completely honest, I was surprised when it came. Surprised enough that it broke my stride. I doubled over. If you’d have seen me, you’d have thought I ran too hard and was out of breath. That’s partially correct. I was finding it hard to breathe. Not because of my pace, but because the answer to my question floored me.\n\n“God, where were you?”\n\nAs an adolescent, on multiple occasions, a close friend betrayed my trust and perpetuated unwanted sexual acts on and towards me. Thank God, I had the wherewithal and ability after the first few instances of abuse to put boundaries up to stop it. But there was one critical thing I failed to do: tell someone. Anyone. For years, it was a deep secret kept between the two of us. And the effects of that were devastating.\n\nOf course, you wouldn’t have known it from looking at me. I kept a cool, calm exterior. But inside, everything was in flux. I was wrestling with questions about my identity, my sexuality, my future, and most of all, about a God who supposedly loved me.\n\nWhere was God on the worst night of my life? I’m not the first person to ask that question. It’s as old as the earth itself. Most scholars believe the first book written in the Bible was Job. What’s the overarching theme of Job? Undue suffering and a God that remains quiet for most of the ride.\n\nJob didn’t give me much respite from my pain. What was I, a teenager who had spent his life dedicate to God, supposed to do with this suffering? If God loves us, if he really is all-powerful and all-knowing, then why do bad things happen? Why do some babies die? Why is there poverty? Why cancer? Why natural disasters, racism, genocide? And, at least for me, why childhood sexual abuse?\n\nAs the years passed between me and the worst nights of my life, I found an alarming truth: just because you’ve forgotten, doesn’t mean you’re healed.\n\nDecades after the abuse, I wasn’t able to enjoy sex with my new wife because every intimate act took me back to times of destruction. I had crippling fear around having kids—would I be able to protect them when I wasn’t able to protect myself? Because my abuser was a male, would I ever be able to have close, meaningful relationships with guys again?\n\nMy first significant step toward healing was opening my trap. Seriously. My wife was the first person to know. It brought a lot of confusion around our relationship into clarity. And her openness, genuineness, and empathy overwhelmed me. For the first time in a long time, I felt known. Loved. Protected. She gave me a safe place and space to heal. In time, with her help, I managed to tell other people who needed to know, including my parents and a handful of close friends. The more I spoke about it, the more I felt the grip of that abuse lessen. It wasn’t a secret anymore, and as such, it didn’t control me.\n\nI found overwhelming freedom in admitting what had happened to me. But it didn’t answer the deeper question: why? There was only one place to find that answer.\n\nIn the Bible, there is a story of a woman named Hannah. Though married for many years, she was unable to conceive. To complicate matters, she was married to a man who had more than one wife. The other wife conceived children in abundance and never failed to throw it in Hannah’s face. Year after year, Hannah remained barren. On a trip to the temple, the Bible records her story in stunning honesty:\n\n\n  Though she was resentful, she prayed to the Lord while she cried.\n\n\nI don’t believe that God expects us to accept the brokenness that happens to us. I don’t believe the lesson is learning to live despite tragedy, to walk away from the fight with a limp but grateful to be alive. Hannah used her resentment to drive her to the only place she could find an answer. And I fully believe God was pleased, even honored, with that resentful prayer. Why? Because it was honest.\n\nIn the spirit of Hannah, I dared to ask God where he was on the worst night of my life. He didn’t owe me an answer. He really didn’t. This isn’t about justice for me. It isn’t about achieving some nirvana-like understanding of suffering and suddenly being okay with it. I do not accept the idea that sexual abuse was part of God’s narrative for my life. I’ll be so bold as to say it wasn’t in his plan. I believe earth is a war zone, the setting for a battle so cosmic in scope and nature it puts anything Marvel has to offer to shame. It’s where right and wrong, good and bad, God and Satan throw punches. The abuse that happened to me was Satan looking to land a death blow, the collateral damage of war.\n\nThat summer night, when I laced up my Asics and hit the concrete, I’d already been asking God my question for a few weeks. He hadn’t answered me yet, but I decided to bring it back up again. I was just about to finish my run when an image took over my thoughts. I may have been running the rolling hills of central Kentucky, but all my senses were back there—in my bedroom at my parents’ house.\n\nIt was that night, and I was there as a fly on the wall, viewing these heart wrenching events as an outsider. The night was still. The room was dark. The abuse had already taken place. I saw my adolescent self, lying awake, trying to understand what had happened to me. And as my eyes adjusted to the dark scene, I saw a figure cowering over me. In his presence was fear, confusion, and a lifetime of brokeness. From his hand extended a fearsome claw. It was raised above me, as a scorpion would raise its stinger. He was preparing to deal a death strike. I could feel it. If he landed this blow, healing would never find me; hurt would perpetuate across generations. I watched my teenage self, lying in bed, unaware of the hurt about to befall it. Without warning, at lightning speed, the clawed hand moved to strike. I winced, preparing for the pain.\n\nAs quickly as his arm moved, it stopped. A hand caught his by the wrist. And like a child breaking sticks, I heard a horrific noise. With a snap, his arm was broken at the wrist. His clawed hand hung limp. Horror filled his face. He was as surprised as I was. And then he was gone.\n\nIt was Jesus. He had caught the claw as it moved to strike. And he broke it completely.\n\nMy physical self, overwhelmed with fatigue from the run and surprised at an answered prayer, doubled over.\n\nI was staring at my feet, gasping for air. My vision continued. I saw Jesus helping my teenage self get out of bed. He didn’t say a thing. But he opened his arms. I fell into them. We both cried. And it was over.\n\nThe rest of the run was a blur. Somehow I made it back to the house and immediately set myself to finding some paper. I needed to draw what I’d seen. In a pinch, I settled for an old cardboard box and a black sharpie.\n\nThat was two years ago. I’m still overwhelmed that God answered my question. Where was he on the worst night of my life? Right beside me. He hurt with me, and had protected me more than I could ever know.\n\nI still don’t know why we suffer. But I do know this: we don’t suffer alone. And, somehow, knowing that means more to me than an answer to the first question.\n\nThis is dangerous thing to write, but I’m going to anyway. If you’re dealing with the ramifications of past hurt, I’d encourage you to do two things. (1) Find someone safe to talk to. If you are suffering, don’t do it in silence. (2) Ask God where he was (or is) in your pain.\n\nI believe God will answer you. Although, I’d say it’s pretty unlikely it will be the same way he answered me. Why? Because I believe God has something more in store for you. Just for you. Specifically for you. And I believe he will answer you in a way that will leave you feeling honored, chosen, and known. Why hasn’t he answered you yet? Maybe, just maybe, it’s because he’s waiting for you to ask.\n\n","link":"https://mediaint.crossroads.net/articles/where-was-god-on-the-worst-night-of-my-life","type":"MediaResource"}},{"id":"CF_p9oq1ve41d7r_7qeWRqD23mMeomwyYUQ4MS","type":"add","fields":{"title":"This Is Scheduled","content":"Body text …","link":"https://mediaint.crossroads.net/articles/this-is-scheduled","type":"MediaResource"}},{"id":"CF_p9oq1ve41d7r_4WQFFAlzH2qWKMSuU0KKmo","type":"add","fields":{"title":"Where was God on the worst night of my life schedule test?","content":"My wife and I had finally gotten our kids to bed, and the cool summer air was calling my name.

Running is just as important to my mental health as my physical. So feeling the pull of the concrete, I found my shoes, put on my headphones, and was out the door.\n\nI’d already gone almost three miles, and was coming around a blind corner, back to our house. I’d been asking one question the entire time I ran. Not out loud, mind you. That’d be weird. But I kept bringing my prayer, my thoughts, back to the same thing. I wanted an answer. And, to be completely honest, I was surprised when it came. Surprised enough that it broke my stride. I doubled over. If you’d have seen me, you’d have thought I ran too hard and was out of breath. That’s partially correct. I was finding it hard to breathe. Not because of my pace, but because the answer to my question floored me.\n\n“God, where were you?”\n\nAs an adolescent, on multiple occasions, a close friend betrayed my trust and perpetuated unwanted sexual acts on and towards me. Thank God, I had the wherewithal and ability after the first few instances of abuse to put boundaries up to stop it. But there was one critical thing I failed to do: tell someone. Anyone. For years, it was a deep secret kept between the two of us. And the effects of that were devastating.\n\nOf course, you wouldn’t have known it from looking at me. I kept a cool, calm exterior. But inside, everything was in flux. I was wrestling with questions about my identity, my sexuality, my future, and most of all, about a God who supposedly loved me.\n\nWhere was God on the worst night of my life? I’m not the first person to ask that question. It’s as old as the earth itself. Most scholars believe the first book written in the Bible was Job. What’s the overarching theme of Job? Undue suffering and a God that remains quiet for most of the ride.\n\nJob didn’t give me much respite from my pain. What was I, a teenager who had spent his life dedicate to God, supposed to do with this suffering? If God loves us, if he really is all-powerful and all-knowing, then why do bad things happen? Why do some babies die? Why is there poverty? Why cancer? Why natural disasters, racism, genocide? And, at least for me, why childhood sexual abuse?\n\nAs the years passed between me and the worst nights of my life, I found an alarming truth: just because you’ve forgotten, doesn’t mean you’re healed.\n\nDecades after the abuse, I wasn’t able to enjoy sex with my new wife because every intimate act took me back to times of destruction. I had crippling fear around having kids—would I be able to protect them when I wasn’t able to protect myself? Because my abuser was a male, would I ever be able to have close, meaningful relationships with guys again?\n\nMy first significant step toward healing was opening my trap. Seriously. My wife was the first person to know. It brought a lot of confusion around our relationship into clarity. And her openness, genuineness, and empathy overwhelmed me. For the first time in a long time, I felt known. Loved. Protected. She gave me a safe place and space to heal. In time, with her help, I managed to tell other people who needed to know, including my parents and a handful of close friends. The more I spoke about it, the more I felt the grip of that abuse lessen. It wasn’t a secret anymore, and as such, it didn’t control me.\n\nI found overwhelming freedom in admitting what had happened to me. But it didn’t answer the deeper question: why? There was only one place to find that answer.\n\nIn the Bible, there is a story of a woman named Hannah. Though married for many years, she was unable to conceive. To complicate matters, she was married to a man who had more than one wife. The other wife conceived children in abundance and never failed to throw it in Hannah’s face. Year after year, Hannah remained barren. On a trip to the temple, the Bible records her story in stunning honesty:\n\n\n  Though she was resentful, she prayed to the Lord while she cried.\n\n\nI don’t believe that God expects us to accept the brokenness that happens to us. I don’t believe the lesson is learning to live despite tragedy, to walk away from the fight with a limp but grateful to be alive. Hannah used her resentment to drive her to the only place she could find an answer. And I fully believe God was pleased, even honored, with that resentful prayer. Why? Because it was honest.\n\nIn the spirit of Hannah, I dared to ask God where he was on the worst night of my life. He didn’t owe me an answer. He really didn’t. This isn’t about justice for me. It isn’t about achieving some nirvana-like understanding of suffering and suddenly being okay with it. I do not accept the idea that sexual abuse was part of God’s narrative for my life. I’ll be so bold as to say it wasn’t in his plan. I believe earth is a war zone, the setting for a battle so cosmic in scope and nature it puts anything Marvel has to offer to shame. It’s where right and wrong, good and bad, God and Satan throw punches. The abuse that happened to me was Satan looking to land a death blow, the collateral damage of war.\n\nThat summer night, when I laced up my Asics and hit the concrete, I’d already been asking God my question for a few weeks. He hadn’t answered me yet, but I decided to bring it back up again. I was just about to finish my run when an image took over my thoughts. I may have been running the rolling hills of central Kentucky, but all my senses were back there—in my bedroom at my parents’ house.\n\nIt was that night, and I was there as a fly on the wall, viewing these heart wrenching events as an outsider. The night was still. The room was dark. The abuse had already taken place. I saw my adolescent self, lying awake, trying to understand what had happened to me. And as my eyes adjusted to the dark scene, I saw a figure cowering over me. In his presence was fear, confusion, and a lifetime of brokeness. From his hand extended a fearsome claw. It was raised above me, as a scorpion would raise its stinger. He was preparing to deal a death strike. I could feel it. If he landed this blow, healing would never find me; hurt would perpetuate across generations. I watched my teenage self, lying in bed, unaware of the hurt about to befall it. Without warning, at lightning speed, the clawed hand moved to strike. I winced, preparing for the pain.\n\nAs quickly as his arm moved, it stopped. A hand caught his by the wrist. And like a child breaking sticks, I heard a horrific noise. With a snap, his arm was broken at the wrist. His clawed hand hung limp. Horror filled his face. He was as surprised as I was. And then he was gone.\n\nIt was Jesus. He had caught the claw as it moved to strike. And he broke it completely.\n\nMy physical self, overwhelmed with fatigue from the run and surprised at an answered prayer, doubled over.\n\nI was staring at my feet, gasping for air. My vision continued. I saw Jesus helping my teenage self get out of bed. He didn’t say a thing. But he opened his arms. I fell into them. We both cried. And it was over.\n\nThe rest of the run was a blur. Somehow I made it back to the house and immediately set myself to finding some paper. I needed to draw what I’d seen. In a pinch, I settled for an old cardboard box and a black sharpie.\n\nThat was two years ago. I’m still overwhelmed that God answered my question. Where was he on the worst night of my life? Right beside me. He hurt with me, and had protected me more than I could ever know.\n\nI still don’t know why we suffer. But I do know this: we don’t suffer alone. And, somehow, knowing that means more to me than an answer to the first question.\n\nThis is dangerous thing to write, but I’m going to anyway. If you’re dealing with the ramifications of past hurt, I’d encourage you to do two things. (1) Find someone safe to talk to. If you are suffering, don’t do it in silence.

And God shows up too, full of power and valor, and even kindness.\n\nThis music was made to be enjoyed with friends, a side of beef on the fire, maybe a smoke or a drink nearby, and souls ready to
